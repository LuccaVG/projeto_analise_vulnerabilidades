# httpx Installation Fix - RESOLVED

> **✅ STATUS: ALL ISSUES RESOLVED**
> 
> This document describes historical httpx installation issues that have been **completely resolved** in the current master installer architecture. This file is preserved for historical reference and troubleshooting context.

## Issue (Resolved)
The httpx installation was failing with the error: `No such file or directory: 'go'` even though Go was installed at `/usr/local/go/bin/go`.

## Root Cause (Fixed)
The Python script was trying to execute `go` command directly without specifying the full path, but Go wasn't in the system PATH when the script was running.

## Solution Implemented ✅

These fixes have been **fully integrated** into the master installer (`install/setup.py`):

### 1. ✅ Improved Go Binary Detection
The master installer now automatically:
- Detects existing Go installations in multiple locations
- Uses full path to Go binary for all operations
- Handles multiple Go installation scenarios

### 2. ✅ Enhanced PATH Setup
The `setup_go_environment()` function now:
- Detects existing Go installations in multiple locations
- Properly adds Go directories to PATH
- Sets GOPATH and GOROOT environment variables
- Creates missing directories as needed

### 3. ✅ Fixed httpx Installation
The `install_security_tools_complete()` function now:
- Uses the detected Go binary path instead of assuming `go` is in PATH
- Implements multiple fallback installation methods
- Provides comprehensive error handling and reporting

### 4. ✅ Improved Tool Detection
Enhanced tool detection throughout the system:
- Checks multiple common installation locations
- Provides clear error messages when tools are not found
- Automatically adds Go bin directory to PATH if needed

## Current Installation Method (Use This)

Simply run the master installer - all httpx issues are automatically resolved:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linux-vulnerability-toolkit.git
cd linux-vulnerability-toolkit

# Run the master installation orchestrator
sudo python3 install/setup.py
```

The master installer automatically:
- ✅ Detects and installs Go if needed
- ✅ Configures Go environment variables
- ✅ Installs httpx with proper PATH handling
- ✅ Verifies all tools are working correctly

## Verification

After running the master installer, verify httpx is working:

```bash
# Check installation
httpx -version

# Test functionality
echo "https://httpbin.org" | httpx -silent

# Verify configuration
cat config/toolkit_config.json
```

## Technical Resolution Summary

The key improvements implemented in the master installer:

1. **Multi-location Go Detection**: Checks `/usr/local/go/bin/go`, system PATH, and `~/go/bin/go`
2. **Full Path Usage**: Always uses complete path to Go binary instead of relying on PATH
3. **Environment Setup**: Automatically configures GOPATH, GOROOT, and PATH variables
4. **Error Recovery**: Multiple fallback methods if primary installation fails
5. **Verification**: Comprehensive testing of all installed tools

## Historical Context (Archive)

*The content below represents the original troubleshooting process and is preserved for reference. These manual fixes are **no longer needed** as they have been automated in the master installer.*

### Test Installation
```bash
python3 test_installation.py
```

### Manual httpx Installation (if needed)
```bash
# Find Go binary
which go
# OR
/usr/local/go/bin/go version

# Install httpx using full Go path
/usr/local/go/bin/go install github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/cmd/httpx@latest

# Add to PATH
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
```

## Verification

After running the fixes:
1. Go should be properly detected at `/usr/local/go/bin/go`
2. httpx should install successfully to `~/go/bin/httpx`
3. Both tools should be available in PATH for subsequent use

The installation script now handles cases where:
- Go is installed but not in PATH
- Multiple Go installations exist
- User doesn't have write permissions to system directories
- Network issues during download

## Notes

- **Linux Only**: This toolkit is designed exclusively for Linux systems (Debian/Kali Linux)
- **No Windows Support**: Windows is intentionally not supported
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Added comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## Troubleshooting

### If httpx still fails to install:
1. Check Go installation: `/usr/local/go/bin/go version`
2. Manually install: `/usr/local/go/bin/go install github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/cmd/httpx@latest`
3. Verify: `~/go/bin/httpx -version`
4. Add to PATH: `export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin`

### If PATH issues persist:
```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$HOME/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Technical Details

The key fix was updating the Go binary detection logic to handle cases where:
- Go is installed in `/usr/local/go/bin/` but not added to system PATH
- Multiple Go installations exist on the system
- The installation script runs in an environment without proper PATH setup

The solution ensures the full path to the Go binary is used for all operations, eliminating the "command not found" errors.

## Next Steps & Ideas for Future Work

### Immediate Tasks (Priority 1)
1. **Complete Shell Script Verification**
   - Verify all `.sh` scripts have correct permissions (`chmod +x`)
   - Test `setup_tools.sh` orchestration on actual Linux system
   - Ensure `fix_repo_keys.sh` properly handles Kali Linux repositories
   - Validate `fix_dpkg.sh` resolves package manager interruptions

2. **Master Orchestration Testing**
   - Test the `orchestrate_installation()` function in `index.py`
   - Verify installation state management (`.installation_completed` file)
   - Ensure proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Test skip logic for already-installed components

3. **httpx Installation Verification**
   - Run comprehensive tests with `test_installation.py`
   - Verify httpx works with different Go installation paths
   - Test fallback installation methods
   - Ensure symbolic links are created properly in `/usr/local/bin/`

### Medium Priority Tasks
4. **Dependency Chain Verification**
   - Test nuclei and naabu installation after httpx fixes
